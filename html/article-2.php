                        Christianity had any significant defenders in the Spain of Calderón, aome critics argue that one
                        of his primary purposes in writing the Autos was to refute Protestant heresy, using the uni-
                        quely Catholic doctrina of tranaubstantiation in the Euchariat as a point of departure.' One of
                        the clearest voices in thia reBpect is that of Sister M. Francis MeGarry who wrote in 1937</p>
                    <p>As the spirit of Protefltantism invaded more and more the countries of Europe, the Eucharistic
                        eharacter of the Autos beeame more and more pronounced. The Auto Sacramental in the strict
                        meaning of the word aa underatood by Calderón did not exist in earlier times because in Spain
                        there was no need of defending the dogma of the Real Presente until this belief gas denied and
                        attaeked by the Bo-called Reformers.</p>
                    <p>Later in the same Btudy she states that “the people of Spain ... used the sacramental play as a
                        means of showing</p>
                    <p class="italic">"General well-known studies bear this point out. See for example'Marce1ino

                        Eucharist.”In recent years Sia- ter McGarry’a theaia, which is ahared by other scholars, has
                        fallen into disfavor. Marcel Bataillon argues that in the early Autoa "la explicación
                        antiprotestante tropieza con graves obje- ciones,” among which he includes the absence of
                        corroborative testimony from contemporary observers and ”la rareza de las alu- siones a la
                        herejía” in the Autos themselvea. Bruce Wardropper supports this opinion, aífirniing that "loa
                        autoa no Burgieron como respuesta a la reforma protestante ni como arma de combate de la
                        Contrarreforma.” 5 He then defers comment on Calderón’a AutOB to A. A. Park.era whose able
                        analyses illuminate the Thomistic premiaes of the Autos as well as their liturgical function in
                        the festival of Corpus,' but nowhere does he speak of their re1ation- ahip to the Reformation.

                    <p>To inerease our understanding of Calderón’s relationship to
                        the Reformation, my primaiy goal in thia atudy is to analyze his understanding of Protestant
                        doctrine, the nature of his refuta- tiona of the same and hia awareness of individual Reformers
                        and their teachinga. Although my principal aim is a eomparative, theological analysiB, I will
                        zupply in pasaing ample evidence which demonatrates that refuting Protestantism was eertainly
                        one of Calderón's purposes, but unlike Siater MeGarry, I will not claim the Eucharistic
                        character of the Autos beeame more pro- nouneed as Protestatism grew (though this may in fact be
                        true), nor will I aeeept M. Bataillon’s challenge to search out ”teBti- monios de los
                        contemporáneos. Rather, I will base my rernarks on the frequent and apecific references Calderón
                        makes to the Reformation in the Autos themselves.

                    </p>
                    <p>But before discuasing Calderón'a views on Protestantism, we must firat examine his concept of
                        apostasy ir general. Although the allegorical characters Herejía and Apostaafa appear fre-
                        quently in Calderón'a AHtOB, I know of no case where they solely repreaent Heformed
                        Chriatianity; rather, in Calderón’s lexicon, "heresy” and ”apostasy” (which I and seemingly
                        Calderón use in- terchangeably) refer to all non-Catholic doctrine. For example, in No hay
                        instante ein mifogro, Fe identifiea Apostasfa not only as ”un falso apóatata” but ”aun toda la
                        apostaría,” thua indicating that apostasy assumeB many guiaes.'° In several of the Autoa
                        Calderón refere to the Greek origin of the word ”heresy” as ”con- trariedad de opinioneB,” an
                        idea that Herejía develope in Lo pro- tectación de la fe:</p>
                    <p class="italic">"Soy, aunque gima y llore, aquella truncada hidra aobre quien mortal veneno en copa
                        dorada brinda

                    <p>The image of the hydra, the multifaced mon9ter present in vari- ous forms throughout Church
                        history, could also characterize Apoatastn in Psiquie y Cupido where he is the father of three
                        he- retical daughters: Gentilidad (paganism), Judalsmo and the un- named but clearly described
                        Reformers. When forced to identify himself he saya:</p>

                    <p>Calderón's understanding of apostasy harka back to the Christian definition of evil itself which
                        ía not conaidered a force independent of good, but rather the absence of good. That is to say,
                        evil does not exist as an independent power battling against good, but entera the world bec£iuse
                        men through their free will do not chooae good and thus allow evil a place. In strict terms, it
                        would be more accurate to speak of good and non-good than good and evil; if we apply this
                        concept to dogma, it is possible to argue that there is no auch thing aa independent anti-truth
                        but only non- truth, that anything leBa than true religion is in fact hereBy. In this senBe,
                        Apoatasfa is a cover Íerm for paganism, Judaism, Is- lam or any other non-Catholic religion, and
                        not merely the aban- donment of truth once embraced. Furthermore, in Calderón’s concept of
                        apostasy, temporal relationshipB lose all significance, and for this reason Calderón can
                        consider Judaism and paganism to be formB of apostasy, although both predate Catholicism. Given
                        such a broad definition of apoataay, I have tried to limit my examples from the Autos to only
                        the most obvious referentes to the Reformation. A more liberal interpretation could perhaps
                        strengthen my argumento.</p>
                    <p>Although today's historians often concentrate on the sociopo- litieal forceB underlying the
                        Reformation, for both Calderón and the Reformera, the basic reaaons for sehism were doctrinal
                        and not political, and for this reason it was not Luther’s famous ninety-five theses rebuking
                        corruption which caused the irrepa- rable breaeh, but rather his radical reinterpretation of
                        sacramen- tal religion formulated in The Babyloriian Copiiutfy three years later." The
                        pretensions of the Roman Catholic Church as the one and only true church depend not so much upon
                        her doctrinal poaitiona, which a non-Catholic could in theory imitate to the letter, as upon the

                        channels of God’s grace to man and therefore indispensable for salvation.1* The Reformers
                        attacked Catholicism at its very heart by claiming that God’a saving grace
                        may be obtained through other channels, and thua undercut aae-
                        ramentaliam, sacerdotalism and ultimately the necessity of a sin-
                        gle, visible church.
                    </p>
                    <p>As a son of post-Trent Catholiciam, Calderón waB well aware of the central thrust of Protestant
                        arguments, and precisely for that reason his refutations of ProtestantiaTit UBUally appeal to
                        the exclusive validity of the CatholiC B£tcraments. For example, in
                        la protestaei6n de la fe he portrays the Church as a beautiful building supported by seven
                        columns representing the seven Sa- craments, and haB Herejía describe hia demonio mission as an
                        ef- fort to steal ”las auxiliares riquesas, / que a la católica curia / envía la Providencia.”
                        Herejía later declares:
                    </p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Calderón then attributes these worda to the "Rey del Norte
                        / donde hoy coronada reina / de Lutero reformada / religión” (pp. 733—34). Thus the real threat
                        of Protestantism iB not found in its disputations about corruption or minor doctrinal mattora,
                        but rather in its attaek on Catholiciam’s vital center: the necesaity of the SacramentB
                        themselves.

                    </p>
                    <p>Calderón direetly refutes thia notion by claiming that aince faith is a gift of God, it is
                        impossible to have true faith in anything but the truth. Coneequently, the Protestant belief in
                        salvation tbrough means other than the Sacramento is not faith at aI1. We find a dramatic
                        illustration of this eoncept in Poiquis y Cupido, where Apostaafa elaims there ia no need to
                        search for God in the Saeraments:</p>
                    <p class="italic">"Yo le traigo [a Dios] en el pecho, que si no es éste, no hay otro
                        Dios de amor ni yo le creo
                        debajo de otros disfraces. (p. 348)"
                    </p>
                    <p>But when ApostaBfa tries to persuade Fe to support hia position, Fe answers, "Primero / i:ne daré
                        niuerte.” In Calder6n’s mind it is through faith that God’s grace in the Sacraments is revealed;
                        once we accept the notion that the Sacraments are necessary channels of God’s grace, it is
                        impossible for faith, aa a gift of God, to bypaas them somehow. Fe's anawer alao recalls St.
                        Jamea's fa- mous dictum that faith without worka ia dead (James 2:14— 26); Catholic commentaries
                        frequently interpret such worka to be man's voluntary acceptance of the Sacraments. Calder6n
                        rein- forces his point that faith is more than belief by having Apostaala demand that hia own
                        free will, Albedrto, persuade Fe to support his cauBe. Albedrlo answers: "Es en vano cuanto
                        intento / si ella quiere reaiatirme; / que yo inclino maa no fuerzo” (p. 349). The message ia
                        clear: although man acceptg God’a gift of himBelf, faith ia not a product of human will, nor can
                        it be equated to sincere belief. As a product of will, Protestant belief, no matter how siri-
                        cere, ennnot be called faith because the object of that belief is false. Paith is granted to
                        those who believe the truth, and only aueh belief can receive God'a gift of faith.'4 What
                        Protestants be- lieve to be true is false; therefore they cannot have faith, and it is nonsense
                        for them to elaim salvation through faith for they have no faith. The underlying tautology in
                        thia argument—truth is what is defined to be true—will never convinee a skeptic, nor would it
                        convince a Protestant who would mere! y define truth dif- ferently from the outset.</p>
                    <p>Associated with Ca1derón’g denial of Protestant faith is his in- sigtence that the Reformers
                        based their arguments on reason. In Psiqiiiz y Ciipido Apostaata's opening speech includes:</p>

                        as did the Counterreforma- tion. Indeed, one nuthority claima that, although Protestantism broke

                        and human understanding for as we Baw earlier he could not accept that their position was based
                        on faith. As Apostasta atates in M iglesia sitiada:</p>

                        y no estoy desengañado. (p. 56)"
                    </p>
                    <p>Although the Reformers redefined the function of the sacra- ments, practices involving
                        confirmation, penance, blessing the sick and other Buch traditions survived to a varying degree
                        in all Protestant bodies. Nonetheless, Calderdn recognizes the validity only of Protestant
                        baptism. We read in £o protestacidri de la [e:</p>
                    <p class="italic">"el hereje es un nervio cancelado, que se aparta porque el cuerpo no inficione;
                        pero no porque no haya recibido en el Bautismo
                        el Sacramento. (p. 746)"
                    </p>
                    <p>Calderón accepts Protestant baptiam for two reasona. On the one hand, Roman Catholicism his
                        alwH9B allowed that anyone, not necessarily a priest, can baptize under extreme circumstancea.
                        On the other, the major Reformers, Calvin, Luther, Zwingli and the Anglieana, agreed essentially
                        with the Catholie view of bap- tism. Only the so-called left wing of the Reformation, particu-
                        larly the Anabaptists, departed radically from the Catholic posi- tion in claiming that baptism
                        W8B & matter of ehoice and should therefore be performed only for adulta aware of its
                        significance, but this ia a problem Calderón never examinen.
                        Occasionally Calderón correctly identifiea a particular Protes- tant doctrine only to
                        misattribute it to a specific Reformer." One such case concerns the sacramentB Luther retained.

                    </p>
                    <p>The heretic so accused is clearly Luther for it waa he who reduced the sacraments from seven to
                        two, but the two he retained were BaptiBm 8nd Holy Communion, not Baptiam and Matrimony. He
                        maintained that the true sacraments must be based on the cen- tral fact of Christianity: the
                        Bacrifice and recurrection of Jesua Christ. Jesus himself in the Words of Institution identifies
                        Holy Communion with his atonement, and St. Paul explains that in Baptism the Christian is buried
                        to sin and resurrected to a new life (Rom. 6:3— 6). But at no time did Luther consider Matrimony
                        a sacrament as Calderón implies in the preceding quotation.</p>
                    <p>Calderón’s eontention in Le igfesio srttada that Matrimony was one of the saeraments Luther
                        retained is doubly eurious aince in No eisma de Anglaterra he suggests that Luther encouraged
                        Henry VIII's divorce, and thia after eorrectly identifying Luther's major Btatement on the
                        sacramental religion, T’/te Babylonian Captiuity mentioned ear1ier.'• In reality, Luther rigidly
                        sup- ported Jesus' condemnation of divorce and remarriage (Mt. 5:31— 32); indeed, one of the
                        most embarrasaing episodeB of Luther’s life was his recommendation to Phillip of Hesse that
                        bigamy, because of Old Testament precedents, was preferable to divorce as a aolu- tion to his
                        marital problema.'•
                        The focal point of the saeramental conflict is the nature of the Eucharist itself, and indeed
                        many scholars would accept VaI- buena Prat's affirmation that ”la presencia real definida

                    <p>In point of fact, both Luther’s and Calvin’s position on the doc- trine of Real Presence is more
                        complicated than Calder6n allowa. Both denied the doctrine of transubBtantiation, but nei- ther
                        doubted heal Presence, nor did they question the notion that The Lord’s Supper waB in fact a
                        channel of grace from and com- munion with God. Luther did, however, challenge the doctrine of
                        sacrifice in the Mass on three counta: first, he felt no man could command God and thereby
                        ”reeacrifice” Christ. Second, he ar- gued that the efficacy of Communion depended on the faith
                        of the communicant and not on the authority of the celebrant; that ia to say he denied the
                        validity of the sacrament in and of itself ex opere operato.” And finally lxe interpreted
                        literally the biblical notion that Christ’s sacrifice on Calvary was at once universal and
                        eternally sufficient with no need for repetitions in the Mass (Heb. 9:26—28).'• But this same

                        required of the repentant Cristina de Suecia: ”iCómo aufres verla absuelta / con Penitencia tan

                        have been inspired by the antimusical currents in certain refor- mist groups such as the
                        Puritans who smashed organs and repu- diated the mugieal liturgy of the Roman and Lutheran

                        scripture. Most Reformers did not aban- don Church tradition in its entirety, and indeed several
                        incor- porated many of the early statements of belief, the Nicean Creed for example, into the
                        Protestant liturgy. However, in casea of conflict, they gave greater credance to Scripture. In
                        No hey ins- taste sin milagro, Apostaala, after being upbraided as ”torpe- mente ciego” and
                        ”bérbaramente bruto” for questioning the Sacraments, replies, ”No to soy tanto, que ya / que me
                        arguyes con un texto, / no te responda con otro” (p, 1343), to which Fe replies:</p>
                    <p class="italic">"Ahora te he conocido, que quien con dañado intento de sacraa autoridades valerse
                        preBume, es cierto ser de aquellos torajidos
                        que npóstatas de mi gremio, como ladronee de casa,
                        capace6 de sus secretoB,

                    </p>
                    <p>Not only does this remarkable passage set the ground rules for a debate we will examine later; it
                        reveala several of Calderón’s atti- tudes towards the Reformers. First, we are told that
                        Protestante do not study Seripture to learn and agaent to God’s truth, but rather to ignore that
                        truth present in the Church. Second, Calderón denies that the Reformers were sincere, even if
                        that meant being sincerely wrong; what they do is "con dañado in- tento”—an attitude which
                        aurvived in some Catholie sectors at least until Vatican II. Viewed against the backdrop of the
                        Coun- terreformation, Calderón’s position is not narrow, but quite un- deratandable. Reason
                        unblemished by evil intention supposedly led inevitably to Catholicism. Dissenters were
                        therefore misin- formed, incapable of reaaon or deliberately wrong. Since Calvin and Luther
                        obviously knew Catholic doctrine as well as the best Catholics, and there was litl:le reason to
                        question their rational powers, only the third posatbility remained.</p>
                    <p>In another interesting reference to the use of Scripture among the Reformers, Herejla in im
                        iglesia sitiada says of the New Testa- ment:</p>
                    <p class="italic">"InB eacriptos convenientes de los sagrados doctores
                        . pmducen flores
                        comn de variaa simientea. (p. 47)"
                    </p>
                    <p>Although Fe responds with a firm ”Mientes,” Calderón may have been defending the Catholic belief
                        that St. Peter's injunction againat ”private interpretation” of Seripture (2 Peter 1:9—21) was
                        directed specifically towai•ds people who, like the Reformers, at- tempted scriptural exegenia
                        untempered by Chureh tradition and the pronouncements of God’s authorised leadership, namely the
                        Popea and Church councils. Catholic apologiats point out that while on the one hand the
                        Protestants claim the Bible ia a auffi- cient source of doctrine, on the other that supposed
                        aufficiency has never provided sufficient baais for union, for the many Protestant secta have
                        indeed proliferated like "flores / como de varias si- mientes.”</p>
                    <p>Another significant challenge to Catholiciam from certain sec-
                        tors of the Reforination concerned the continuing presence of apir- itual or charismatie gifts
                        in the Church. Uaing the Bible aa a point of departure, Apostasfa in No hay inctante ain
                        milagro, poaeB the problem aa follows:
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">"Crietodíjo
                        por Marcos en su Evangelio que a los que au Fe edmitieaen aeguirtan los portentos
                        de que lanzarían demonios, de que en idiomas diversos nuevas lenguas hablartan, que las
                        serpientes vendiendo, no les dañaría beber
                        los más nocivos venenos; y, en fin, que dartnn salud

                    </p>
                    <p>Apostaafa then cites examples, mainly from the Acts of the Apos- tles, of each miracle, and in so
                        doing underlines a basic argument of the Reformers: that the Reformation merely attempted to re-
                        turn to primitive Christianity, to restore the uncorrupted biblical church. Apostasfa then
                        risks:</p>
                    <p class="italic">"Pues siendo así, que estos dotes gozaron los que creyeron,
                        ¿qué se hicieron sus prodigioa?
                        ¿Adónde están suB portentos?

                        Dioa a la Fe prometió milagros, hoy no loa vemoB;
                        luego no hay hoy Fe (en tua fielea, ae entiende), no hey hoy fi’e; luego no hice yo mal en dejar
                        de andar en Bn seguimiento. (p. 1343)"
                    </p>
                    <p>As noted in our discussion on Scripture, Apoatasf a in this scene i,s clearly identified with the
                        Reformation, yet despite the paren- thetical aside, "en tua fielea, Be entiende,” Calderón does
                        not allow the Protestant to finish his argument, namely that the presence of the charismatic
                        gifts in Reformist sects and their aupposed ab- sence in Catholicism demonstrated God’s approval
                        of the former and diaapproval of the latter.</p>
                    <p>None of the mainline Protestant bodies used the arguments advanced by Apoataata, and for that
                        reason the moat likely tar- gets of Calderón’s rebuttal would be the radical left-wing of the
                        Reformation, the biblical literalista like the Anabaptists whose position on the charismatic
                        gifta embarrassed both Calvin and Luther alike. Since the left-wingers wrote relatively little,
                        disas- sociated themselves from political movements and avoided form- ing large organizations,
                        we know surprisingly little about them and even less about Calderón’s contact with them.</p>
                    <p>More interesting is the nature of Calderón’a rebuttal.
                        Apostasfa’a charge iB ili reality unfoiinded sinee Catholicism never repudiated the Spiritual
                        Gifts, and indeed many Catholic saints were canonised for performing mirncles like those
                        mentioned by St. Mark. But Calderón makea no attempt to list such occurences to Apostaata,
                        perhapB because he knew some Protea- tants would make the carne elaimB. Instead, he again baBes
                        hia rebuttal on the exclusive validity of the Catholic aacraments, claiming that the gifts in
                        question do indeed occur regularly in true sacramental religion. To illustrate his point,
                        Calderón has Mary Magdalene testify that since ”en los pechos de cualquiera / son esp/ritus
                        inmundos / las culpaa,” the Sacrament of Penance can east our devils. Similarly, Dimas claima
                        that Penitencia made him immune to poiaons since ”los ofensas / son en los pechos de todos /
                        venenos” (p. l35íí). Constantine claima that hia leproay of original sin was cured by Baptism,
                        and later Confirmación ex- plains how St. Augustine learned to speak in new tonguea:</p>
                    <p class="italic">"Y en prueba
                        de que le habla alcanzado, retraetando erradas ciencias, se confirmó en la Verdad, cuya
                        Confirmación muestra,
                        que habla nuevas lenguas; pues
                        ¿qué mús hablar lenguas nuevas, que decir aygr ermreB
                        falsos y hoy verdades ciertas? (p. 1355)"
                    </p>
                    <p>And finally, Saul of Tarsus describen how Communion was the antidote to snake bites since he,
                        prior to his eonversion, ”llevó víboras y letraB” in his breaBt, but now ”víboras y letras hoy /
                        arroja al fuego” (p. 1356). The several threads of the Auto finally converge in the Sacrament of
                        Communion, Apostasfa recognizea hia error, and, in a gesture unusual in the Autor, he apprÓaches
                        the Lord’s table and is forgiven. We muBt not overlook the im- portant fact of Calderón's
                        argument: although he could have reaf- firmed the Church’s belief in mirncles, he chose to base
                        hia refuta- tion on the Sacraments.</p>
                    <p>Aside from the Protestant rebellion against aacerdotaliBm and sacramentalism, no single iBsue
                        affected the Reformation more
                        than the question of free will vs. predestination. Perhaps as old
                        as Christianity itself, the prfiblem has roots in the writings of St. ‘
                        Paul and was first studied seriously by St. Augustine. On the one hand the Church claima that
                        man ia free to make limited choices which aífect his salvation, while on the other it teaches
                        that for salvation man depende totally on the grace of an all knowing (can man act eontrary to
                        God'a knowledge?) and all-pow- erful God (if all power resides in God, how can man be free to
                        act on his own?). The logical incompatibility of both propositions is eonsidered a myBtery, and
                        for that reason the Church allows its theologians great latitude in trying to reaolve the
                        confiict. Ca1derón’a several dramatic analyBea of the problem most fre- quently reflect an
                        ongoing debate within Catholicism and are not uBually concerned with the Reformers cho sided
                        firmly with the advocates of predestination. For that reason I will limit my ob- servations on
                        the matter to a particular Auto, Lo pnotestación de la fe, which deals specifically with
                        Lutheran’s difficulties in un- derstanding the problem before converting to CatholiciBm.°°
                        In Lo protestaeión de la fe, Cristina de Suecia becomes con- vinced that her inherited Lutheran
                        belief cannot explain the prob- lem of free will and predestination. She seeks instruction in
                        St. Auguatine’s works which, perhaps not coincidentally, led aome of the Reformers to support
                        predegtination. She feels unhappy

                    <p>In the preceding passage Calderón offerB support for both sides of the debate and in the proceas
                        prepares the ground for his forth- coming refutation of' the Protestant concept of
                        predestination. He clearly states that salvation depends not on man's merit but on God’a grace,
                        but at the same time he mentions that man must recognise and accept the auxiliaries through
                        which God imparts grace. In other words, man is totally dependent on God’s grace for aalvation;
                        that is to aay, by no act of his own doea man some- how “earn” salvation. Nonetheless, man’s
                        free agency is not to- tally absent from the picture, for man must avail himself of the
                        auxiliaries. Calder6n avoids the stickier problem of thoBe who never know of the auxiliarieB and
                        the unresolvable matter of God’s knowing what decision man will make before he makes it.
                        Predictably, Cristina finds those auxiliaries in the Sacraments and then declared herself,</p>
                    <p class="italic">"religiosamente libre,
                        y libremente espontánea, a las llaves de la iglesia sujeta hoy, como vaaalla de su Imperio, la
                        que ayer
                        era Reina de su Patria. (p. 745)"
                    </p>
                    <p>To which Sabiduría reaponds:</p>
                    <p class="italic">"Ya con esa abjuración,
                        que entre la oliva y la espada has hecho, la paz te toque,
                        pues la justicia se envoina. (p. 745)"
                    </p>
                    <p>In other words, apart from the Sacraments there is no real free- dom; free agency has meaníng
                        only if one of the options ia salva- tron. Since man of his own efforta cannot merit savation,
                        hia free agency acquires substance only when he chooses to receive the Sacramento. Without the
                        Sacramento man ia damned, and Calderón implies that the Proteatanta, whose religion Cristina has
                        abandoned, have no choice but that damnation demanded by justice. In a word, they are
                        predestined to spiritual death. Both Luther and Calvin felt that God's elect lxad been chosen,
                        as St, Paul aays, since before the foundation of the world (Eph. 1:3— 12), and clearly both
                        believed certain of the neformers rere among the chosen. Calderón does not argue with Paul; he
                        merely claima that without the Sacramento, there are no elect.</p>
                    <p>In conclusion, several points ahould now be clear. First, al- though refuting ProtestantiBm was
                        not Calderón’a primary goal in the Autos, his frequent referencea to Protestant doctrines and tO
                        individual Reformers give considerable support to the anti-Protestant thesis deBcribed earlier;
                        those who maintain oth- erwiae ignore overwhelming textual evidence to the eontrary, some of
                        whieh has been cited in this study. Second, Calderón was familiar with the major arguments of
                        the Reformers although it is difficult to determine how much he knew. For example, hia faílure
                        to recognize Luther’s careful distinction between Real Presence and transubstantiation does not
                        neceasarily indicate ig- norance or miainformation. A Gatholic apologist, Calderón was not about
                        to give Proteatantism a "fair hearing” by telling all he knew in the public square. As in hia
                        treatment of Satan a8 a dra- rnatic figure, Calderón allows his hereties to apeak but not con-
                        vince.*’ Third, Galder6n fails to identify the Reformation ae a se- ríea of religious
                        movements—Lutheran, Calvinist, Zwinglian, Anglican, Anabaptist, etc. —and in the process ends up
                        blaming Luther and Calvin for almost everything; although aware of major doetrínal currenta in
                        Protestantism, he knew less of the di- visions among the Reformera themselvea. And finally, his
