                    <p>On first glance, Vida y hechas dcl iliistrc caballera don Catrln dc la Ndc$rn& hardly seems
                        morally ambiguous. After all, it is a novel in which priests refute heresy, crime leads to
                        poverty, and the sinful body, even before death, becomes corrupt. I argue in this article,
                        however, that a fundamental ambiguity lies at the core of the novel, an ambiguity reflected in
                        the debate between traditional authority on one side and modernity (or rnJini mo if I may be
                        allowed a useful neologism) on the other. I further contend that this debate reflects a conflict
                        between two Lizardis, one a cauti reformer who from 1814 to 1820 survived fairly
                        ' well in Ferdinand sttiltifying New Spain, and the other a fire- breathing militant who flirted
                        with, but did not entirely embrace, the moral uncertainties of the modern age. But before
                        analyzing these as- pects of the novel, first a word (longer than I would like) about the two
                        Lizardis.
                    </p>
                    <p>1820—the year Lizardi finished Don Cdo/n and the year ]osé
                        de Iturbide began his successful campaign against Spain—was a water-
                        , shed for both Lizardi and Mexico. Don Catrln lies on the cusp of that ' change. Although nor
                        published until ten years later, in early 1820 the novel was presented in manuscript to the
                        Inquisition's Board of Cen-
                        ' sors who issued the following decree on February 22, 1820:
                    </p>
                    <p class="italic">"La vida y hechos de D. Catr]n de la Fachenda con las notas del Pensador americano
                        es un jocoserlo con que se ridiculiza a los viciosos n erecedores de este eplteto por su vida
                        libertina, deduciendo una sana moral conque arreglen sus sentimientos y deberes a los de la
                        religión. (cited in
                        S]aeIl 123)"
                    </p>
                    <p>Of course, Lizardi had not always 6otten on so well with the Church.
                        His early enthusiasm for the 1812 Constitution of Cädiz made him
                        suspect of “liberalism.” Early issues of his periodical, Al pensador mexicans, founded in 1812,
                        enthusiastically defended the Constitution's key provisions constitutional monarchy, freedom of
                        the press, repre- sentative government, and parliamentary rule. Yet, as this list suggests,
                        Lizardi was hardly a Jacobean radical. He deplored populism and fre- quently expressed doubts
                        concerning the potential of Mexico's lower classes for self rule. Possibly the event that most
                        marked Lizardi's for- mative years occurred in 1810 when he and other principal citizens of
                        Taxco feigned support of Miguel Hidalgo's insurrection to keep Hidalgo's maurauding hordes from
                        sacking the city. The ruse worked too well, for a year later, when Captain Nicolás Cosío
                        restored the city to Spanish rule, Lizardi was taken prisoner to Mexico City for supporting the
                        insurgency. Lizardi eventually cleared his name, but his fear of Hidalgo- style populism earned
                        him the distrust of radicals, while his llluminist reformist made him just as suspect to
                        ultra-royalists (Spell 117).
                    </p>
                    <p>Lizardi's public devotion to liberalism suffered even further with Ferdinand VI1’s rise to the
                        Spanish throne in 1814. Indeed, the intel- lectual chill brought by Ferdinand's restoration of
                        the Mexican Inquisi- tion no doubt contributed to Lizardi's decision virtually to abandon his
                        newspaper and begin writing didactic novels like El periquillo Damiento, the firsr volume of
                        which appeared in December of 1815. Ever vigilant against heresy, the Holy Office carefully
                        scrutinized Lizardi's novels but apparently found insufficient grounds to charge him with
                        heresy: Mexi- can conservatives, however, continued distrusting him. Except for some
                        unpleasantness in 18 17 regarding the fourth volume of ñ/ prriqui//n sarnicnto (the censors did
                        not like Lizardi's criticism of slavery), Lizardi had few problems with f•erdinand’s viceregal
                        government, partly be- cause the pemndar kept his criticism unfocussed and made many moves to
                        flatter the powerful. Indeed, Don CoJfn itself might be seen as one such move given its
                        favorable portrait of priests, its condemnation of Rousseau (Cd/r/it 14), and its equation
                        of“liberalisrri” with heresy (Catrln 70). In sum, as the above quotation reveals, the Church
                        judged Don Cds/n to be what Lizardi evidently intended: a defense of the faith and a cautionary
                        tale against immoral thought and behavior.</p>
                    <p>But suddenly Mexico changed, and apparently so did Lizardi. In March of 1820, one month after Dan
                        Cofr/n received the Censors' imprimatur, Rafael Riego led an assault on Ferdinand VII and forced
                        the king to swear allegiance (yet again) to the Consitution of Cadiz. News of the Riego
                        rebellion and the King's born-again devotion to constitutionalism allowed Lizardi to found a
                        new. newspaper, El conductar eléctrica, dedicated to promoting constitutional monarchy. In the
                        manifest announcing the new paper Lizardi asserts, “Viva la Nación Espafiola, viva la unión,
                        viva la constitución, y el digno Rey que la juró” (Ord/ola, 6/ conductor, n. pg.) In the first
                        issue Lizardi painstakingly ignores the king's previous contempt for the constitution, arguing
                        that the Monarch had mercly been led astray by “el egoísmo, la adulación, la tiranía, la
                        barbarie, el despotismo, la hipocresía, la superstición etc. [qrie] se presentaron en la funesta
                        escena, vestidos con los brillantes trajes de Iu lealtad, amor a Jr permite, Justicia,
                        ilustración, i•berunl i, airnid y religión.” These evil advisors “le hicieron creer a este buen
                        Monarca que la Nación estaba disgustada con el gobierno de las Cortes, y ansiosa de ser regida
                        por el antiguo ..." (El c0nductar, June 1820, 2). Whether Lizardi believed such nonsense is
                        anyone's guess; more likely than not, he fett that Fernando wouÍd continue to rule in New Spain
                        come what may, and that Holding hÍm to t[ie constitution was the only real option for progress.
                        These early issues of El condyctar argue persuasively Por the guarantees of the constitution and
                        wax particularly eloquent in their defense of freedom of the press and the rights of Blacks to
                        full citizen- ship. He also condemns the Inquisition as something alien to true Chris- tianity
                        and further argues that religious orders should be ruled by local bishops (Spell 126). Sucli
                        positions, of coutse, dcd not etidear him to the conservative hierarchy.</p>
                    <p>Lizardi's devotion to the Ining didn't last, Only a few months after praising Ferdinand while
                        denouncing his evil advisors, Lizardi pro- claimed his support of José de Iturbide's campaign to
                        separate Mexico from Spain altogether. (Iturbide, by the way, was the first insurgent Lizardi
                        ever supported.) So taken was Lizardi with Iturbide that he es- tablished a printing operation
                        in Tepoztlán that produced pampl lets praising the lturbide insurgency and Itur5ide’s famous
                        Plan de Iguala of Februrary 12, 1821. He later celebrated Iturbide's victorious entrance into
                        Mexico CÍty with these words:</p>
                    <p class="italic">"Yo espeto que en lx primera sesión del Congreso, por aclarnación se le
                        destine el trono. iO! tenga yo el gusto de besar una vez la mano del
                        ’ Emperador de ra América, y cierre la muerte mes ojos para siempre. (cited in Spell l2ú)"
                    </p>
                    <p>Iturbide's preening incompetence soon dampened Lizardi's enthusiasm. On November 18, 1821, he
                        published a famous pamphlet titled Cincuenta preguntas para quien quiera contestarlas in which
                        he questions Iturbide's commitment to constitutional liberalism as framed in the Cádiz
                        Constitution. The pamphlet also criticizes Iturbide's syco- phantic courtiers, among whom were
                        several high clerics. Iturbide him- selfobjected to the pamphlet, but Lizardi did not let up. On
                        February 13, 1822, he published an even more audacious pamphlet titled Defenza de los
                        Francmasones in which he argues against several papal condemna- tions of Masonry, holding that
                        "no puede menos que ser santa una religión, secta o comunidad donde el fundamento es la
                        beneficencia, el amor al género humano, la hospitalidad y el desinterés" (Defenza 3). Lizardi
                        further defends Masonry as an authentic religion by pointing to its scriptural base, and later
                        dismisses papal pronouncements on the subject as acceptable "según las luces de su siglo" but
                        hardly atuned with modern enlightment (Defenza 6). He thus not only defends a he- retical sect;
                        he also questions the authority of not one but several papal pronouncements.</p>
                    <p>Not surprisingly, given the Church's histeria on the subject, Lizardi's defense of Masons brought
                        swift judgeinenr. Eíght days alter the pamphlet appeared, Lizardi was excommunicated, a
                        punishrnent puticularly harsh in his society since it involved a kind of shunning that bro ugtit
                        him to the verge of financial ruin. Nonetheless, quite un- 1i1‹e the accommodationist who wrote
                        pdf/n, Lizardi continued his attacks on the government while also protesting his
                        excommunication. Indeed, so consumed was he with hís ecclesiastical status 'that church- related
                        subjects dominate most of bis late writings. When no printer would publish his work, Lizardi
                        hought his own printlng press and continued writing for a clandestine market, albeit for very
                        little inoney. During the constituent convention of 1823 he militated for a kind of separation
                        of church and state, and was profoundly disappointed wheñ the constitution of 1824 legalized
                        only the Roman Catholic Church.
                        Only after Guadalupe Victoria's eleccion as Mexico's first constitutional
                        president did Lizardi pull in his horus. He made peace with the Church, ' and in 1825 Victoria
                        appointed him editor of a government newspa-
                        per, a position he held until his death in 1827. Despide the government appointment, however,
                        Lizardi did not die in functionary patadise, partly because his enemies missed liaving the old
                        Lizardi to kick around. In 1826 one of these, José Marla Aza, published a pamphlet reminding
                        Mcxicans that the Lizardi now at peace with the Church and in the
                        employ of a revolutionary government had often been investigated for heresy, opposed
                        Independence heroes like Hidalgo and Moreno, and supported the repressive Ferdinand VII, Not
                        amused by Aza's accusa- tions, Lizardi lnought charges against him for defamation of character.
                        Unfortunately for Lizardi, Aza came to court armed with such convinc- ing evidence that the
                        court ruled in (nvor of Lizardi's accuser (Spell 127—38).</p>
                    <p>Y com this brief sketch v'e see that Dan Catrln de la hacienda
                        indeed lies between two quite clifferent Lizardis: the accommodationist Lizardi whose novel
                        pleased the Censors in February of 1820 and the impassioned militant who only months later
                        supported and then op- posed Iturbide, defended Masons, and fought excommunicaüon.t
                        didactic work blessed by the Church, the novel would seem to charac-
                        terize tÍie earlier figure and have little to do With the later one, and indeed critics lilce
                        Dinko Cvitanovic, Marla Rosa Palazón, and Catherine Beroud have analyzed the book primarily in
                        terms of its didactic quali- ties.
                    </p>
                    <p>My goal in this article, howcver, is to show that such is not the
                        casc, that although Lizardi wrote Don Cd9fn as a cautionary tale, a moral fissure underJies the
                        novel, a fissure that has Lizardi the accomodationist on one side and Lizardi the fiiebrand
                        rebel on the other. Specifically, I argue that Lizardi's desire to use Don Catrfn as a bad
                        example threatens to get away from him, and that at times Catrin
                        and his fellow rnirinri, like Milton's disfigured angel, sound alarmingly
                        persuasivo and not unlike the Llzardi whO would later defeiid Masons
                        and defy church hierarchs. 1 further contend that Catrln becomes so persuasive that Lizardi the
                        accommodatioiiist has no choice but to in- fect, mutilate, and kill him. To justify Catrln's
                        destruction, this Lizardi
                        reveals a moral authoritarianism that is quite at odds with the pluralis- tic spirit of the
                        militant Lizardi who emerges later. And finally, I pro- pose that Catrfn and catrinismo
                        ultimately resemble the modern spirit in ways that might have secretly pÍeased their author.
                    </p>
                    <p>To begin, there is little question but that Lizardi iiitended Don
                        Cafrfn to be a cautionary tale, a didactic Pro rlc that would teach by way
                        ofbad example. As Catrln himself puts it, ". . . el objero que me propongo
                        . es aumentar el número de los catrines; proponerles mi vida cOliiO modelo” (4). Nor does Dan
                        Catrln differ in any significant ideological fashion from his earlier work. Rather, it
                        faithfully reflects a New World
                        enlightenment as NancyVogeley has perceptively analyzed, but departs, in significant ways from
                        the Golden Age picaresque, as Lasarte has shown Where Don Catrin does differ from Lizardi's
                        earlier novels is in its structure for unlike the picaros in El periquillo sarniento, the
                        carinen Don Catrine haver a real voice and hold spirited arguments with their accusers.
                        Consequently, we can actually speak of catrinismo as a kind of philosophy, a kind of
                        anti-morality, whereas we would be hard pressed to identify lizardi's picarismo as a doctrine of
                        any sort. By giving His catrinesa real voice and by following that voice wherever it might lead,
                        Lizardi unleashes a force he later has a hard time control- ling. But I get ahead of my
                        argument. At this point we should first examine the nature and substance of catrinismo.</p>
                    <p>Catrinismo turns out to be a much more sophisticated philosopy than Lizardi might have intended.
                        Allow me a couple of examples of the catrines' extraordinary view of the world. Profoundly
                        shaken by a scolding received from his uncle, a priest, Catrín hears the following advice from
                        his fellow catrin, Don Tremendo:</p>
                    <p class="italic">"Olvídate de esas palabras con que te espantó el viejo tonto de tu tio. Y pasa
                        buena vida. Muerie, eternidad y honor son fantasmas, son cocos con que se asustan los mtichacl

                    </p>
                    <p>Don Tremendo's advice, of course, is hardly anything Lizardi wants us '
                        to take seriously. Yet, whatever Lizardi's intentions, Tremendo's argu- ments show considerable
                        sophistication. For example, his words on
                        death: “tquién temera a la muerte, cuando eI morir es un tributo debido ' a la naturaleza! Muere
                        el hombre, lo mismo que e1 perro, el gato y aun
                        e1 ;irbo1, y asI nada particular tiene la muerte de los hombres.” Is this not modern biology, a
                        Description of the essental oneness of all living things? Is there not an echo here of Newtonian
                        physics and their im- plicit determinism—a determinism quite at odds with notions of God and
                        free will? Similarly, when Tremendo says of eternity, “¿quién la ha visto, quién ha hahlado con
                        un santo ni con un condenado! Esto es
                        quimera, is this not a statement of the materialist hypothesis, an idea that would place
                        Tremendo and by extension tado el catrinaje 1n the not unenviable company of David Hume and
                        other modern spirits! what do we say of his argument that honor “es una palabra elástica que
                        cada uno le da la extensión que quiere Esto lo has visto, la gracia
                        está en saber pintar las acciones y dictar las partes”? In arguing. tllát words are elastic,
                        that meaning is unavoidably a human construct, does not Tremendo unwittingly support Plato's co
                        ntentio n in the Crdtylw that the meaning of words is merely a matter of convention? Similarly,
                        when today's postmodernist enthusiasts contend that apparent knowl-
                        edge is merely discourse, and discourse masks power, are they COtlU some sense repeating
                        Tretnendo's insight that “la gracia esta en saber pintar las acciones y dictar las partes”? In
                        sum, sophisticated readers of many ages—and perhaps even Lizardi liimself—might be forgiven por

                        (63). To this accusation Catrln responds:</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>What Lizardi the traditional moralist wants to condemn here is relativ- ism. He would like us to
                        conclude that theft, prostltution, drunken- ness, and aggression are always wrong. What Catflft
                        says, however, is that certain individuals mi6ht be driven to thievery because of need, that
                        prostitutes might rise from social Coiidltions in ivhich comen have nothing to sell but their
                        bodies, that brave people may be justified in resorting to agression, and that in a society
                        tolerant of different opin-
                        ions, even heresy is permissible. In sum, despite Lizardi's eviden r desire
                        to demonize such attitudes, those very attitudes are markers of plural-
                        ism and the soul of intellcctual freedom. Indeed, Catrln's relativism
                        manolo se ms closer to the modern spirit than Lizardi's apparent hunger for moral absolutes.</p>
                    <p>As a philosophy in its own right, catrinismo need its own commandments. To this end Lizardi has
                        Catrin present us with a decalogue he attrióutes to Machiavello by way of Albertus Magnus—an odd
                        aitri- bution if we consider that Albertus Magnus predated Macliiavello by nearly two and a half
                        centuries and the commandments in question most surely did not issue from the pen of
                        Machiavello. Of these “Ma- chiavellian” commandments Catrln underlines the fourth: “Aulla con
                        los lobos,” which lxe explains a couple of pages later in the following fashion</p>
                    <p class="italic">". comencé a observar exacramente el decálogo, especialmente e$ cuarto precepto,
                        haciéndome al genio de todos cuantos podían serme útiles; de manera que dentro de pocos dfas era
                        yo cristiano con los cristianos, calvinisrii, luterano, urriano, etc., con los de aquellas
                        sectas; ladrón con el ladrón, ebrio con el borracho, jugador con el tahtír, mentiroso con el
                        embustero, implo con el inmoral, y mono con todos. (72—Z3)"</p>
                    <p>Obviously; Lizardi cloes not think one should be a “mono con todos.” Yet, what is wrong with a
                        society where Calvinists and Lutlierans might have a place? How does the pluralist society that
                        Lizardi apparently supported only two years later in his rabid opposition to officializing Roman
                        Catholicism, not to mention his defense of Free Masonry, dif- fer from Catrln's vision of a
                        society where even Lutherans and drunk- ards have the right to be wrong? Where do the
                        accommodationist Lizardi
                        and his radical other half draw the line between diversity and , unacceptability* As Catrln's
                        faithful scribe, Lizardi allows these ques-
                        tions to be raised, but he fails to let any of Catrfn's opponents answer them, perhaps because
                        they have no good answers, particularly for some- one lilce Lizardi who is drawn to pluralistic
                        relativism get nostalgic for
                        absolute truth.</p>
                    <p>We cannot but wonder, however, why Lizardi chooses relativ- pummeling. In previous worlcs he had
                        ridiculed cor-
                        fion and inmoral behavior, but seldom before docs he seek out a philosophy or doctrine.
                        Moreover, of all available coils, why
                        dñes,he single out relativism for such harsh treatment? Of course, there
                        isno way of lcnowing an author’s motives, and certainly no reason we shoúld, confiné our reading
                        to seeking out the author's intentions. I
                        would suggest, however, that Lizardi's construction of Catrln as a rela- tivíst was a ploy to
                        ingratiate himself to the Church on chat was argu- ably the touchiest subject of the time: the
                        question of authority: who
                        determines truth, and who has the power to suppress “CffO£"!
                    </p>
                    <p>To a remarkable degree much of history can be reduced to a struggle to answer these questions. In
                        his noteworthy boolx, fnoetinng the People, Edmund Morgan carefully traces how the rule of kings
                        slowly replaced by the notion of a soveriegn people in whích the king's loyal subjects become a
                        collective of citizens with innate rights, one of those rights being that of self-government
                        through the expression of
                        individual opinion, (Morgan, /siim). Thls evolution consisted of a
                        gradual displacement Of Ruthoríty, a displacement by which a subject people became a self-ruling
                        people to whom the formerly sovereign king yielded autlxority. The vety notion of democratic,
                        representational rule presupposes a variety of opinions and a relativism not unlilce the
                        atritudes parodied in Catrln. Even worse from rhe absolutist perspec- tive, representative
                        government in some sense replaces truth with con- scnsus, rÌght with accoinmodation of
                        difference, déio/pfiimp with a kind
                        of rdfrioiima.
                    </p>
                    <p>These subtleties were not, of course, lost in debates on liberal- ism, and no doubt Lizardi knew
                        that his defense of traditional author- ity would please the hierarcky on such a basic issuc.
                        The Cuestion in the Church, of course, was not whether the people had rights of some sort, but
                        whether popular sovereignty could replace tradicional social and ecclesiastical hierarchies, The
                        Church Cottld point to a grand tradicion oY canCern for the people. Drawing from SCfipttlre,
                        Catholic tho ught is repleto with prescriptions and proscriptions for leaders, be they mon-
                        archs, princes, oz factory owners. Good civic leadership in CathollC thinking promotes the
                        material and spiritual welfare of the people, and
                        is particu[ar1y concetned with proteCting the weak from the strong, the
                        poor from the rich, the disenfranchized

                        the majority. Indeed, traditional Catholic thinkers, inc]c1diflg tl4C current rope, continually
                        criti- cize liberal democracy Yo opening doors co bullies and leasing the weak
                        unprotected.
                    </p>
                    <p>What is not found in tradicional Catholic thought, however, is consistent support for the notion
                        that people should create systems of self-government, particularly when that process involves a
                        diferencia de opiniones,” sóme of which—inevitably—must be wrong, if not licentious and sinful.
                        Indeed, one of the central heresies of Protestantism was its location of authority in the
                        congregation of believers. Protes- tants, or at least most Protestants, turn CathOlic polity on
                        end by say-
                        ing that God's will is manifest through the collective voice of the people
                        rather than the Church's magisterium, that the people, however sinful as individuals, can, when
                        properly constituted as a congregation of be- lievers, articulate the will of God. Calvin for
                        example, after a lengthy disquistion on Biblical examples ofecclesiastic appointments writes
                        thar ’We therefore hold that this call ofa minister is lawful acCording to the
                        Word of God, when those who seemed fit are created by the consent
                        and approval of the people” (Calvin 21—23). The central importance of governance in the
                        Reformation is yet borne out by the names of major Protestant bodies. Congregationalists locate
                        authority in local congre- gations to such a degree that Congregational ministers can be
                        dismissed at any time by a majority vote. Episcopalians, in comparison, locate authority in the
                        episcopate, the council of bishops who, although elected,
                        have near dictatorial powers once they are in office. In contrast, from Calvin on, Presbyterians
                        look to the presbytery, a kind of elected legis- lature with representatives from several
                        congregations, to make their- important decisions.
                    </p>
                    <p>Claimed by political liberalism as well as protestant polity Rome made no secret of its
                        preference for hierarchical systems in the civic as well as the ecclesiastical sphere. On
                        January 30, 1816, Pius VII asked that his “venerable brethren, Archbishops, Bishops and dear
                        sons of America, subjects of the King of Spain” render “due obedience to your King” (cited in
                        Kennedy 23—24). Eight years later, in 1824, Leo XII called on the American bishops to work for
                        the return of the Americas to the rule of the King of Spain. It was nor until 1885 with the
                        publica- tion of Pope Leo XIII's famous encyclical Inmortale Dci that the Vatican finally
                        accepted democracy as are of the permissible forms of government</p>
                    <p>Thus we see that, however humorously framed, Catrln's defense of “una diferencia de opiniones” is
                        highly relevant to the period. In- deed, by calling authority itself into question, he is
                        touching on argu- ably the most sensitive topic of his time, a topic for which governments fell
                        and heads rolled. Nor is it difficult to see why catrinesque relativism as particularly odious
                        to the absolutist mind. For Catrln not only questions the existence of absolute truth; he
                        manifests a remarkable indifference to its very existence. In sum, by refuting such attitudes,
                        Lizardi was guaranteed to please the traditionalists.</p>
                    <p>Yet, by creating a character to express those views, he was also playing with fire, so much so
                        that very soon in the novel Lizardi's big- gest unstated problem is how to silence his unruly
                        cow/zi. In trying to control his creation, Lizardi may have sensed the frustration that drove
                        Unamuno to describe novels as nion/ar, as works that somehow write themselves and reduce authors
                        to little more than scribes for their char- acters. Had Lizardi been a less passive witness of
                        his character's develop- ment, Catrin might have emerged as yet another fool, something lilce
                        Periquillo, entertaining but essentially mute. Catrln and his fellow catrincs, however, develop
                        their own vciice and proclaim their own ideas. Nonetheless, despite many priestly Culminations
                        against them, Lizardi remains their faithful scribe.</p>
                    <p>Recognizing that Catrln is getting out of hand, Lizardi involves Catrfn in conversations with
                        several worthy fold whose job it is to set Catrfn straight—a task of course that is also
                        Lizardi's. And who are these worthies? For the most part they are priests: Catrln's uncle
                        (65—66), a couple of non-specified clérigos (67), and a tediously pious § racticante who
                        delivers the epitaph (107—09). But not only do priests admonish Catrln. On one occasion he is
                        condemned by a count who throws him out of his house (75). And on another he is scolded by a
                        virtuous mili- tary officer, Don Modesto, who maintains that “e1 oficial que tiene e1 honor de
                        militar bajo las banderas del rey, debe ser atento, comedido, bien criado, humano, religioso y
                        de una conducta de legltimo cabaI- lero” (24). Thus, by speaking through priests, aristocrats,
                        and mi/iforri., Lizardi refutes Catrln's co/riniimo; or said differently, Lizardi's authori-
                        ties represent the Church, the aristocracy, and the army. Is it any won- der that Lizardi begins
                        to suspect that he needs to do more, that the voice of these secondary fgures just isn't enough
                        to silence Catrln?</p>
                    <p>So what does Lizardi do? He intrudes in his own narrative usin g
                        a time-honored technique beloved by scholars: he inserts footnotes.
                        Through footnotes Lizardi identifies himself in his own voicé as Catzln's real opponent, the one
                        who argues through the voice of priests and soldiers, and then backs them up with footno red
                        scriptural references and commentary. Initially, Lizardi's footnotes on)y give Biblica] refer-
                        ences to support the arguments of the priests trying so earnestly to silence the catrinesque
                        demon (fn., 70), When Biblical references prove
                        insuffícient, Lizardi inserta bis own commentary. For example, when Catr{n argues again that no
                        one has seen heaven or heil, Lizardi inter- jects himself in a footnote With a curt “Asf piensan
                        los que no saben en qué consiste e| verdadero honor” (f.n., 106). On the same page a sec- ond
                        footnote quotes Scripttire, followed by the more trenchant, “‘La
                        pas de los pecadores es pésima' dice el Espíritu Santo” (f.n., 106). We
                        tan only assume that this reference to the Holy Ghost suggests that Lizardi cou1dn't find the
                        exact Biblical quotation, so he “merely” foot- noted the alleged author of Holy Writ. Modern
                        scholarship would, of course, demand greater specificity a Biblical referente or perhaps a dated
                        interview.
                    </p>
                    <p>But in the final analysis even the moral argumento of priests, aristocrats, army of{icers,
                        Scripturc and the Holy Ghost cannot silence
                        the catrines'iricreasing1y bothersome voice. Thus Lizardi resorte to plagues
                        and scourges. Catrín's soulmate, Don Taravilla, is infected with syphi- lis, or as he puts it,
                        “Venus me ha maltratado, que no Marte. Cinco veces ha visitado Mercurio las cédulas de mis
                        htiesos, haciéndome sufrir dolores inmensos” (89). Later, wounded by a jealous husband, Catrln
                        has a leg amputated (92). And finally his body fills with fluid from dropsy, or as he puts it,
                        “Una anasarca o general hidropesla se apoderó de mi precioso cuerpo; me redujo a no salir de
                        casa, me tiró en la cama” (103). Plus Lizardi shows that sin inevitahly corrupts tke body, and
                        by implicatiori contraste Catrln's fresh that rots in life to the bodies of saints that remain
                        incorrupt even in death. But despite such afflictions Catrln dies unrepentant (106). In the last
                        words of the novel the practicante who cares for him to the end finally says what Lizardi wanted
                        to say all along: “¡Pobre Catrfn! ¡Ojalfi no tenga imiradotes!” (108). ln sum, the novel that
                        begins with Catrln's desire to replícate himself ends with Lizardi's hope that such will never
                        happen.
                    </p>
                    <p>At this juncture three points should be clear. First, Lizardi saw Catrln and rdJinúmo as real
                        Rangers, so much so that discrediting him, demonizing him, and eventually killing him became
                        rhetorical necessi- ties. Second, the novel is ultimately a dialogue between Lizardi and his own
                        creation, a dialogue in which the creatíon occasionaly seems to out-argue his creator. And
                        tliird, one finds in catrinismo several atti- tudes that, despite Lizardi's ironies and
                        moralizing, seem amenable to the moderii spirit, and perhaps to the Lizardi who only weeks later
                        would take on the Church, the ersatz emperor Agustín I (as Iturbide wanted to be called), and
                        the Constituenr Convention. For cafrinffmo suggests a world where there is no absolute good,
                        where no one is de- finitively right, where no authority serves for all, where individual and
                        thereby relative perspective matters. Or said differently, cdfrizii›inn sug- gests a kind of
                        pluralism that would have spared the militant Lizardi lot of trouble. That Lizardi demonizes
                        SVCh pluralism in the figure of Don Catrln is obvious; less obvious is the possibility that this
                        dialogue
                        between the autko£ And his creation is in fact a dialogue between two sides of Lizardi's soul,
                        one that found a niche for itself in Ferdinand VII's repressive New Spain and another that
                        fought repression on a trul}' hetoic scale.
                    </p>
                    <p>And it is here that we find Lizardi's ciisi s of moral authority. As
                        a reforrner, as a liberal steeped in Illuminist reading, as a supporter of the remarkable Cadiz
                        Constitution of 1812, Lizardi defended freedom of expression, freedom of religion, freedom of
                        the press, and freedom of debate as well as the liberal institutions in which such freedoms
                        could be acted on. What he does not accept in the novel, however, is the lact rhat these
                        freedoms, to have any meaning at all, must include a dose of
                        cnwiaiitno that allows for a diversiry of opinions and a world where
                        even Lutherans, Calvlnists, prostitutes and catrines have the right to be wrong. Lizardi
                        repeatedly tried to embrace rhe world of liberal plural- ism and often carne close to doing so.
                        Yet, he álso wanted IO bring God,
                        absolute truth, and tcriptural authority with him. That these two worlds—liberal relativism and
                        traditiOnal absolutism—might ultimately be incompatible wi th each other surely occurred to
                        Lizardi. Bu when faced with true relativism in the persona of his literary creation, Don
                        Catrln, Lizardi saw no choice but to siÍence him with priestly sermon-
                        izing, drown him in scripture, and make him die as the result of frlOf degeneracy. I would
                        suggest, however, that although Lízardi lcilled Catrln sometime in the early part of 1820,
                        echoes of catrinesque pluralism, despide its demonized form, are audible in the rebel Lizardi
                        who, prior to dying seven years later, insisted that his body haVC a public viewing so his
                        enernies would know that he had not been taken to Heh (fipell 140)</p>
